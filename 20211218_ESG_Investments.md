## Disclaimers

1. Nothing here should be considered financial advise but merely opinions. Everyone makes their own investment decisions and bears consequences.

## What is ESG
ESG is an acronym for Environmental, Social & Governance. These are new angles from which we look at the companies and effects of what they do. 

ESG It is not about charity. The profit is still the main goal. New factors help that goal by avoiding controversial or risky assets. The side effect is that companies try harder to be fair, otherwise they struggle to get financing.

If you'd prefer to sacrifice profits for bigger positive impact, there is a separate class of products called "**impact funds**".

## Worth to watch

The amount of data to assess E, S & G factors is immense. The scores and ratings are subjective. The methodologies are many. A company can be ESG leader in one assessment system while average in another one. This causes confusion. 

In response, the regulations and standards are taking shape. The works are moste advanced in the EU, but the US are advancing fast. Those regulations and standards will shape a lot of the future and require high effort in data works from many parties.
